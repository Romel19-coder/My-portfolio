      <p>Luksong Baka, meaning "jump over the cow" in Tagalog, is a popular traditional Filipino game where players jump over one person who is acting as the "cow". The "cow" crouches down, and other players jump over it, attempting to clear the jump without touching or falling. If a player touches or falls, they become the new "cow". The game continues as the "cow" gradually raises, making the jump more challenging. </p>

        <p>Luksong-baka is a Philippine folk game that has a very long history. It is a type of tag game that is mostly played by children and frequently throughout the Philippine countryside. This game is both fun and competitive and it is often used by families to bring everyone together.

            The origin of Luksong-baka dates back to the pre-Hispanic era of the Philippines. According to the legend, during a time of unrest, the Tagalog tribe led by Datu Buyung Buaya would often go to war against the Kalanguya tribe. Tired of his tribe fighting, Datu Buyung Buaya used the opportunity of the war to teach the younger generation how to outsmart and outrun their opponents. He used the game of Luksong-baka to train the children and teach them how to be swift, agile, and intelligent.</p>
        <p>Luksong-baka is played with two teams, each having an even number of players. The team that has its members in a line or row acts as the “Bakas” or jumper, while the other team stands in a circle and serves as the “Lukso” or runner. The players in the Bakas team have to stand in a straight line, with each player standing side by side. The players in the Lukso team have to stand in a circle with feet apart. The game begins with the Lukso team trying to run outside the circle. At the same time, the Bakas team has to try and catch them by jumping over them or using their hands or feet to tag or catch them. Whoever gets tagged by a player from the Bakas team automatically becomes a Bakas and joins their team. The aim of this game is for the team tagged the least amount of times to win the game.

            Apart from its fun and competitive nature, Luksong-baka also has some benefits. Firstly, it encourages physical activity, as it encourages players to be swift and agile and it also helps in the development of motor skills. Secondly, it helps players to develop social connections with team cohesion, which is important for successful group activities. Lastly, Luksong-baka also encourages imagination and creativity, as the players use different strategies to outsmart each other.</p>
